What is itWorks?
----------------------

Remember those dark days, when your internet didn't work? when you would  
plug in your external hard drive and watch movies, maybe check your  
downloads folder for \*insert some weird package here\*, browsing  
/usr/share/doc to read something thats intresting, all the while  
regularly pinging a site to know if you're internet is up or not?  

Well itWorks automates that last part.  
It keeps trying to ping a website( by default www.google.com )  
until the ping is successful, and when it does, it shows a dtop  
notification to the user.
